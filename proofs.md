1. Direct Proof

2. Proof By Contradiction 

3. Proof By Contrapositive

4. Proof By Cases 


## Useful Definitions used in Proofs 
1. Even - An integer x is even if there exists an integer y such that x = 2y.
2. Odd- An integer x is odd if there exists an integer y such that x = 2y + 1.
3. Rational Numbers- set Q, can be written in form a/b in which a and b are nonzero integers with no common factors. 
- The difference of rational numbers is rational. 
- Let x ∈ Q. Then ∃a,b ∈ Z such that x = a/b. 
4. Irrational Numbers- cannot be written in the form a/b in which a and b are nonzero integers with no common factors. 

- (∀x ∈ S) P(x)
This means that P(x) is true for every x in the set S

R = the set of real numbers,
Q = the set of rational numbers,
Z = the set of integers,
N = the set of natural numbers (nonnegative integers),
Z+ = the set of positive integers
